## **Theme Customizations**

This theme allows customizations to artwork without the need to edit the source XML. 

### Wallpapers
- Use the folder called `wallpapers` in ES-DE's theme directory at: `ES-DE/themes/canvas-es-de`
- Inside are .webp images named after the color schemes.
- Save over any of these with your new wallpaper to change that color scheme look.
- Alternate wallpapers are also stored in the "Alternate" folder as an example.
- Animated wallpapers in a gif format can be saved into the "Animated" folder. These will be displayed instead of the corresponding wallpaper color. This can be VRAM/CPU intensive.
